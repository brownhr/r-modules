## Question 1: 
Use the `poly2nb()` function to create a Rook's case neighbor construct by changing `queen = TRUE` to `queen = FALSE`. Call this new object `rook_nb` in your code. Plot a map using `tmap` that shows the counties, the connections as lines, and the county centroids as points. Include a title (hint: use `main.title` if you want to have the title outside the map frame).

```{r q1}

rook_nb <- poly2nb(NC_UTM, queen = FALSE)

NC_centroids <- st_centroid(NC_UTM)

nb_lines <- nb2lines(nb = rook_nb,
                     coords = NC_centroids$geometry)
tm_shape(NC_UTM) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(nb_lines) + tm_lines() +
  tm_shape(NC_centroids) + tm_dots(size = 0.2) +
  tm_layout(
    main.title = "Rook's Case Neighbors")

```
