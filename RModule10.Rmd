# Spatial Regression in R

Regression residuals are the primary way to assess if a regression violates any assumptions of the general linear model. Although all the assumptions are important, the violation of the assumption of independence is common with spatially organized data. This has led to the development of a family of alternate regression models that can accommodate spatial dependence. We'll work with two of theme models continuing from the previous two R Modules. These are known as the *spatial lag model* and *spatial error model*. Both models account for spatial dependence by including new parameters that must be estimated; each model, however, handles this in a different way...

## Spatial Lag Model

The spatial lag model, shown below, introduces a new explanatory variable and an associated coefficient that must be estimated:

$$ y = \rho W_y + \beta X + \varepsilon$$



## Spatial Error Model


$$y = \beta X + \varepsilon; \;\varepsilon = \lambda W \varepsilon + \xi$$
