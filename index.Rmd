## Welcome to GHY 5800 -- Advanced Quantitative Methods in Geography


The labs for this course -- R Modules -- will cover a variety of topics in not only quantitative methods and statistics, but also will guide you to become a better programmer in R, even if you have no prior experience. Each R Module is designed to cover two things; a programming lesson from beginner to intermediate R, and a lesson meant to teach a concept in quantitative methods.
