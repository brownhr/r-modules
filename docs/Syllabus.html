<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>This course provides a critical introduction to quantitative methods
commonly used in the analysis of applied geographic research problems.
The content of the course is geared towards the discussion and practice
of common research techniques and theoretical aspects used to
investigate issues in human geography, physical geography, GIScience,
and community and regional planning. Specific topics include reliability
and validity, research ethics, survey design, case study methods,
descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, spatial statistics,
univariate statistical methods, multivariate statistical methods,
regression analysis, and spatial autocorrelation. Adjustments to the
methods covered may be made per the composition of the class on a
semester by semester basis.</p>
<p>This course will be structured like a survey of research methods. As
we survey the methods, we will read practical “how-to” literature, but
we will also collectively seek out examples of well-done research using
these tools, and trace the ways that scholars have used these methods,
including a discussion of how they built their argument around specific
modes of analysis. Readings will be provided by the instructor and
active participation in discussion by all students is expected during
class meetings. Mindful reading and participation are therefore critical
to discussion and exploration of research in each student’s area of
interest. Students are expected to read all materials prior to class and
prepare weekly comments or questions on each week’s reading.</p>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level2">

</div>
<div id="statement-on-black-lives-matter-diversity-and-inclusion"
class="section level2">
<h2>Statement on Black Lives Matter, Diversity, and Inclusion</h2>
<p>The faculty and staff of the Department of Geography and Planning at
Appalachian State University strongly affirm that Black Lives Matter. We
stand in solidarity with those seeking to change systemic racism,
inequality, and discrimination. We are appalled and saddened by the
recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Nina
Pop, Tony McDade, and many others. We support the statements released by
the American Association of Geographers and American Planning
Association that identify that these deaths are the product of racism,
violence, and inequities and likewise support the demands for diversity,
equity, and inclusion from the American Geophysical Union. Emphasizing
human rights, enhancing diversity, promoting inclusion, and advocating
for historically marginalized social groups are central to the
disciplines of Geography and Planning. We affirm a commitment to resist
and confront the devaluation of people of color by recognizing our role
in creating and maintaining these systems.</p>

<li>10% Participation</li>
<li>12.5% Final Exam</li>
<li>12.5% Midterm</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div id="weekly-assignments-and-lab-exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly Assignments and Lab Exercise</h2>
<p>Weekly assignments will account for 20% of the final grade in this
course. These will consist of readings, discussion assignments, and/or
in-class assignments as well as lab exercises. The lab exercises are an
integral part of the quantitative methods portion of this course. The
labs are designed to support our discussions in the lecture by providing
application-based examples of the numerous quantitative analysis tools
that we will be discussing. Weekly readings are also required. Students
must prepare a discussion assignment related to the reading and bring a
copy to class.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="seminar-leadership" class="section level2">
<h2>Seminar Leadership</h2>
<p>We will alternate the leadership of the seminar throughout the
semester. Seminar leaders will guide us through the readings and provoke
discussion on the topic at hand. This should include doing a little
research to find out the disciplinary backgrounds of the authors and
other relevant information. Seminar leaders should arrange to meet with
me and discuss their presentations before the seminar –- ideally by the
week before class. Part of this work will be to select a “model method,”
for the class to explore. That is, the team leading the discussion
should select an example of an exemplary use of the method in question
for the rest of the class to read and think about. This should be posted
to the course website a minimum of five days before the seminar. Each
participant should lead once over the course of the semester. I will
bring a schedule to the first class.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>Participation is required for every class period. Participation will
be graded as an assessment of student performance after each class.
Dr. Sugg will assign a score to each student during each discussion
period from 1 to 5 (1 is failing to participate in any way and 5 is
participating in the fullest). If any students were lacking in
participation roles, Dr. Sugg will talk to them to offer suggestions for
improvement during the course. Discussion is a necessity for a graduate
seminar, failure to participate in weekly discussions will result in a
low participation grade. As the course progresses, more discussions will
be online and feedback to your peers is required via online discussion
forums and peer review feedback.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="final-research-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Research Project</h2>
<p>Each student will complete a final project that will account for 30%
of the final grade. Students should integrate feedback from the research
design workshop. The research project must combine the use of
quantitative methods to answer a question (or questions) concerning a
Geography or Planning related topic of the student’s choosing. I suggest
that you use this component to bring ideas from class into conversation
with your own research focus. If you have an alternative suggestion,
please feel free to talk to me about it! I am very flexible on this
assignment provided it draws on work from the class but also takes it
beyond the cases and readings that we have covered.</p>
<p>Each student will be required to have their topic approved by
Dr. Sugg by the end of the third week of the semester. The final project
will have two components: 1) a professional-style research paper (~10
pages) that includes Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results,
Discussion, and Conclusion, and 2) An oral presentation of the research
which will occur during the allotted final exam period. In addition,
your grade will also include your evaluation of other students. This
research paper will demonstrate the knowledge and effective application
of quantitative research methods to a research topic selected by the
student.</p>
