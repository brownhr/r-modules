GHY 5800 -- Advanced Quantitative Methods in Geography


## Course Description

This course provides a critical introduction to quantitative methods commonly used in the analysis of applied geographic research problems.  The content of the course is geared towards the discussion and practice of common research techniques and theoretical aspects used to investigate issues in human geography, physical geography, GIScience, and community and regional planning.   Specific topics include reliability and validity, research ethics, survey design, case study methods, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, spatial statistics, univariate statistical methods, multivariate statistical methods, regression analysis, and spatial autocorrelation. Adjustments to the methods covered may be made per the composition of the class on a semester by semester basis.

This course will be structured like a   survey of research methods.   As we survey the methods, we will read practical “how-to” literature, but we will also collectively seek out examples of well-done research using these tools, and trace the ways that scholars have used these methods, including a discussion of how they built their argument around specific modes of analysis. Readings will be provided by the instructor and active participation in discussion by all students is expected during class meetings.  Mindful reading and participation are therefore critical to discussion and exploration of research in each student’s area of interest.  Students are expected to read all materials prior to class and prepare weekly comments or questions on each week’s reading.  


## Learning Outcomes

Specific course objectives include:

1. Building a knowledge-base and toolkit of quantitative techniques that enable students to appropriately collect and analyze data
2. Developing a professional research project demonstrating research methods skills
3. Enabling students to confidently and carefully interpret the results of data analyses and clearly communicate those results
4. Exploring how to design studies to collect appropriate data for addressing research questions
5. Improving writing, communications, critical thinking, and analytical skills within the context of the course content

## Required Readings

There are no required textbooks for this course; assigned readings will be provided in PDF format and posted on the AsULearn Site for this course. Readings will consist of a combination of peer-reviewed publications and chapter exerpts from some of the following sources:
