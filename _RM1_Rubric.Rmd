# R Module 1 Rubric

This R module is pretty simple; there aren't that many difficult questions. Students should mostly just be able to load and run R Studio.

```{r}
# Load data
library(MASS)

head(painters)
```

Question 1:

```{r q1}
hist(painters$Composition)
```


Question 2:

```{r q2}
barplot(table(painters$Expression))
```


Question 3: 

```{r q3}
pie(table(painters$School))
```
